excerpt: 'Partition dependence occurs when people assign greater total probability to an event when theevent is described as the union of two separate sub-events rather than a single event (Tversky and Koehler,1994). For example, partition dependence predicts that people would perceive the two sub-events"France will win the World Cup 2022" and "Brazil will win the World Cup 2022" asmore probable than the logically equivalent single event "Either France or Brazil will winthe World Cup 2022". In a field experiment with sports bettors who participate in a prediction tournament, I investigate whether bettors indeed causally assign greater probability to two sub-events than the logically equivalent joint event.'
