excerpt: 'The leadership literature has long speculated that legitimacy is an important covariate of power, its consequences and perceptions (Bass and Stogdill 1990). One might therefore expect that negative behavioral reactions, i.e. reductions in effort provisions in presence of power are governed by the perceived legitimacy of the powerful party. In this project, we address this question by using direct manipulations of legitimacy to understand its causal impact on agents' effort provision, controlling for monetary incentives. '
