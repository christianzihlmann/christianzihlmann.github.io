excerpt: 'We study an after-sales market with a mixed population of consumers. Standard
consumers behave in line with classical theory and evaluate the base good and the
add-on independently. Other consumers are relative thinkers and compare the price
of the add-on with the price of the base good, resulting in their willingness-to-pay
for the add-on to be increasing in the price of the base good.'
