Welcome! I am a Professor at [Bern University of Applied Sciences](https://www.bfh.ch/en/about-bfh/people/dzwdfoxjvumj/). I earned my Ph.D. in 2022 at the [University of Fribourg](https://www.unifr.ch/ecopol/en/departement/research-fellows.html), where I am also affiliated as a research fellow.

My [research](publications) is in microeconomics and focuses on understanding behavior in organizations. I am also interested in experimental methods and open science. I have recently been awarded a [grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/222695) to study the impact of knowledge work and new technology on organizations and society, starting in summer 2025. 

Teaching means a lot to me, and I love interacting and engaging with students, always trying to inspire the next generation of decision makers.
