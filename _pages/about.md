Welcome! I am a Lecturer at the Business School of the [Bern University of Applied Sciences](https://www.bfh.ch/en/about-bfh/people/dzwdfoxjvumj/). I am also a senior researcher at the [University of Fribourg](https://www.unifr.ch/industrie/en/chair/team/christian-zihlmann.html), where I received my Ph.D. in 2022. 

My [research](publications) is in microeconomics, with a particular focus on understanding incentive compensation, judgment and decision making, and questions related to industrial organization. I am also interested in methods and open science. I have recently been awarded a [grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/222695) to study the impact of knowledge work and new technology on organizations and society, starting in 2025. 

Teaching means a lot to me, and I love interacting and engaging with students, always trying to inspire the next generation of decision makers.
