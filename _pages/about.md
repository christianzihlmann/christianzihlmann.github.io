Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) at the Business School of the [Bern University of Applied Sciences](https://www.bfh.ch/business/en/). I am also an affiliated senior researcher with the [University of Fribourg](https://www.unifr.ch/ses/en/). 

My [research](research) is in behavioral and experimental economics, with a focus on questions related to organizational economics, innovation and industrial organization.  For example, I [investigate](research) how hindsight bias may distort the principals' evaluation of the agent, in what dimensions workers shirk when controlled and whether their effort depends on the perceived legitimacy of the manager's authority, and how behavioral interventions may foster innovation. In a recent project conducted during the FIFA World Cup 2022, I seek to understand whether sport bettors are subject to partition dependent probability judgments and whether this affects market efficiency. 
My most recent work is within a [SNSF grant](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/204577) in which we aim to shed light on how errors in statistical reasoning may reshape standard insights from organizational theory. I study these topics using state-of-the-art experimental methods, both in the lab, online and the field. 

[Teaching](teaching) means a lot to me and I love to interact and engage with students, always trying to inspire the next generation of decision-makers. 




I am a data scientist applying machine learning tools and causal
inference techniques to remote sensing data. I am also an affiliated
researcher with the [Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project](https://dapp-lab.org)
and a research collaborator with the 
[Research on International Policy Implementation Lab](https://bridgingthegapproject.org/ripil).

# I earned my Ph.D in Political Science from the [University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu). My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in *International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*, *Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*, among other outlets. This [research](research) explores the causes and consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While primarily focused on civil conflict, it also examines contentious political phenomena including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develops new measures of institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in both quantitative methodology and international relations, and am a certified instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org).
