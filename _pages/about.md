Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) at the Business School of the [Bern University of Applied Sciences](https://www.bfh.ch/business/en/). I am also an affiliated senior researcher with the [University of Fribourg](https://www.unifr.ch/ses/en/). 

My [research](publications) is in behavioral and experimental economics, with a focus on questions related to organizational economics, innovation and industrial organization.  For example, I investigate how hindsight bias may distort the principals' evaluation of the agent, in what dimensions workers shirk when controlled and whether their effort depends on the perceived legitimacy of the manager's authority, and how behavioral interventions may foster innovation. In a recent project conducted during the FIFA World Cup 2022, I seek to understand whether sport bettors are subject to partition dependent probability judgments and whether this affects market efficiency. 
My most recent work is within a [SNSF grant](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/204577) in which we aim to shed light on how errors in statistical reasoning may reshape standard insights from organizational theory. I study these topics using state-of-the-art experimental methods, both in the lab, online and the field. 

[Teaching](teaching) means a lot to me and I love to interact and engage with students, always trying to inspire the next generation of decision-makers.
