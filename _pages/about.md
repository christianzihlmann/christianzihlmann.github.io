Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) at the Business School of the [Bern University of Applied Sciences](https://www.bfh.ch/en/about-bfh/people/dzwdfoxjvumj/). I am also a senior researcher with the [University of Fribourg](https://www.unifr.ch/industrie/en/chair/team/christian-zihlmann.html). 

My [research](publications) is in behavioral and experimental economics, with a focus on questions related to organizational economics, innovation and industrial organization. I employ state-of-the-art experimental methods, both in the lab, online and the field. [Teaching](teaching) means a lot to me and I love to interact and engage with students, always trying to inspire the next generation of decision-makers.
