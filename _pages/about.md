Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor at the Business School of the [Bern University of Applied Sciences](https://www.bfh.ch/en/about-bfh/people/dzwdfoxjvumj/). I am also a senior researcher at the [University of Fribourg](https://www.unifr.ch/industrie/en/chair/team/christian-zihlmann.html), where I received my Ph.D. in 2022. 

My [research](publications) focuses on understanding behavior in organizations, particularly the reactions to (monetary and non-monetary) incentives, evaluation distortions, and creativity. I am also interested in experimental methods and open science. I have recently been awarded a [grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/222695) to study the impact of knowledge work and new technology on organizations and society, starting in 2025. 

Teaching means a lot to me, and I love interacting and engaging with students, always trying to inspire the next generation of decision makers.
