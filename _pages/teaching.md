# Research plays a central role in my teaching as students improve their analytical skills and master the tools of data analysis through hands-on experience. I have taught undergraduate courses on political violence and statistical methodology. While at UNC, I taught the graduate statistics lab for Advanced Topics in Political Data Science, where my work was recognized by the Political Science Department's Earle Wallace Award for Graduate Student Teaching. I also served as a teaching assistant for courses in international relations and American politics at UNC, in addition to the ICPSR Summer Program where I was a teaching assistant for a course on Bayesian modeling in the social sciences. I am also a. [certified instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/#jayrobwilliams) with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), which develops evidence-based methods for teaching "essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research."
